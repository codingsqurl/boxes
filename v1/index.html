            <h3>Fire Mitigation</h3>
            <p>Why Fire Mitigation Matters

Colorado living means wildfire risk. Mitigation creates <br> defensible space around your home, protects your neighbors, and keeps you compliant <br> with local regulations. Plus, many insurers offer discounts—check with your agent.</p>

            <h3>Storm Damage</h3>
            <p>Colorado weather hits hard—hail, high winds, and heavy snow can crack, split, or topple trees without warning. Damaged trees aren't just ugly; they're a real danger to your home, power lines, and family. We respond fast to clear fallen trees and remove hazardous limbs before they cause more damage. Whether it's one branch or a whole tree through your fence, we'll get your property back in shape. Need help with an insurance claim? We can document the damage for you.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Pruning</h3>
            <p>Regular pruning keeps your trees healthy, safe, and looking their best. Dead or overgrown branches can block sunlight, invite disease, and become hazards in storms. We trim strategically to improve structure, boost growth, and protect your property. Whether it's shaping a single tree or maintaining your whole yard, we've got you covered. Healthy trees start with proper pruning.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Removal</h3>
            <p>Sometimes a tree just has to go—whether it's dead, diseased, or dangerously close to your home. In Colorado, beetle-kill is a major concern: mountain pine beetles have devastated millions of acres, and the outbreak continues to spread along the Front Range. Infested and dead trees aren't just eyesores—they're fire hazards, falling risks, and can spread beetles to healthy trees nearby. We handle removals of all sizes, from tight backyard spaces to large trees near power lines, and we dispose of beetle-kill wood properly to prevent further spread. No stump, no mess, no stress.</p>
